# password_cracker
My version of JetBrains Academy project called "Password Hacker".
It's a simple TCP client that connects to a given server on a given port and tries all logins from a dictionary in all case combinations and brute-forces a password.
It's also worth mentioning that it was created for a very particular scenario. For furhter use the code should probably be enhanced and fitted for your need.
The script takes 2 arguments - the host and the port in that particular order.
